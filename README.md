"# Week4ChallengeGuestBook" 


REQUIREMENTS

You have been asked by your client to create an online Guestbook. It will allow guests to
sign, and allow everyone else to see all the messages that have been posted. 

Build an application that allows users to add posts, list all posts, view and delete single post. Guests are allowed to update and/or delete anyone's posts. 

Your client has requested specifically for a unified look across all your pages. Your program manager has made these styling mandatory:

Same navigation bar across all pages. 
In the navigation bar, give your app a name (eg. "Taylor&Oscar's Wedding")
Each button must have meaningful names (ie. "Home" is fine. "Link1" or "Page1" is not.)

Each post should have, at the very least : 
name
date
